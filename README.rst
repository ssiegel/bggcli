Introduction
============


``bggcli`` is a Command Line Interface providing automation for tedious tasks on
`BoardGameGeek <http://www .boardgamegeek.com>`__ (aka BGG). It relies on the Web UI and not on the
`official API <https://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2>`__ which doesn't offer all features available.

Only 3 operations are implemented at this time:

* bulk import/update for your game collection from a CSV file
* bulk delete from a CSV file
* bulk export as a CSV file, WITH version information (game's version is missing in the default export)

Warning:

   * Use it at your own risks, you may damage your game collection by doing mistakes! Ensure you have a backup of you
     collection first!
   * This tool is not supported by BoardGameGeek, this is an independent development
   * Be respectful regarding BGG web site: this kind of automated tools can impact performance when used
     "aggressively" (plenty of requests per second). Provided features are intended to be used for
     one-shot needs. Also they rely on a real web browser, and should conform with their
     `Terms of Services <https://www.boardgamegeek.com/terms>`__


Installation
============
Python 2.7 is required.

::

    pip install bggcli

Usage
=====
Type ``bggcli`` to get the full help about available commands.

Here is an example to export a collection from an account *account1* and import it to another account *account2*::

    $ bggcli -l mylogin1 -p mypassword1 collection-export mycollection.csv
    $ bggcli -l mylogin2 -p mypassword2 collection-import mycollection.csv

Update a collection
-------------------
Here are some use cases this operation could be used for:

* Create a new account on BGG and transfer your collection: export the collection from the old account first, then use
  **bggcli** to import it
* Make a bulk update for all or some of your games: export the collection from your account first, modify details in
  the CSV file (using a text editor, OpenOffice, MS Excel, or whatever) and use ``bggcli`` to import the file

Export should be done with this tool to be complete. You can also do a manual export online, but you won't have
information about the version of each game.

Example:::

    $ bggcli -l mylogin -p mypassword collection-import mycollection.csv

Notes:

   * Column names are those exported by BGG. Any column not recognized will just be ignored
   * When a game already exists in your collection, game is updated with provided CSV values only, other fields are not
     impacted. You could only update one field for all your game.
   * Games are identified by their internal ID, named ``objectid`` in CSV file (name used by BGG). Collection items are
     identified by the ID named ``collid`` (for modifying or deleting existing items). Having the ``objectname`` field
     (name of the game) is also recommended for logging.


Remove games from a collection
------------------------------
Goal is to remove from your collection all games identified in the CSV file you will provide as input.

Example:::

    $ bggcli -l mylogin -p mypassword collection-delete mycollection.csv

Notes:

  * Only the ``collid`` column will be used for this operation: this is the internal ID managed by BGG. All other
    columns will just be ignored.

Export a collection
-------------------
Will create a CSV file with all your games, as you will do with the UI.

Example:::

    $ bggcli -l mylogin -p mypassword collection-export mycollection.csv

Notes:

  * Only the ``collid`` column will be used for this operation: this is the internal ID managed by BGG. All other
    columns will just be ignored.


Limitations
===========

* Some fields are not exported by BGG: the ``language`` field related to the game's version and the ``Inventory Date``
  and ``Inventory Location`` in the private info. The missing ``language`` field only applies to custom version you
  define yourself, which should be quite rare.


Ideas for future versions
=========================

Here are some ideas of additional tasks that could be implemented:

* Generic import for collections, based on game names and not on the BGG internal identifier. A confirmation would be
  required for each ambiguous name to choose among matching games provided by BGG
* Update/Delete for plays
* Update/Delete for forum subscriptions

Final note
==========

Does it really deserve such a development? Probably not, but my second goal was to discover the Python ecosystem!
